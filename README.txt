This project aims to plot electron density as a "fog" rather than with isosurfaces using jasp.
The code has been adapted from the examples in dft-book and the example given on http://docs.enthought.com/mayavi/mayavi/auto/example_chemistry.html. The mayavi documentation on volume rendering (http://docs.enthought.com/mayavi/mayavi/mlab.html#visualizing-volumetric-scalar-data) and the jasp documentation for plotting charge density (https://github.com/jkitchin/jasp/blob/master/CHG.py) have been used as reference.
Examples of  python code have been written for the CO and the H2O molecule.


This repository contains an example org file, a pdf file with all the figures and the 2 images generated for the CO and H2O molecule.
